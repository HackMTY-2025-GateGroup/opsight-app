# AR Interaction Features

## Overview
Enhanced AR trolley scanning with gesture controls, improved visibility, and better surface detection feedback.

## New Features

### 1. 🎯 Drag to Move Trolley
**How it works:**
- Once trolley is placed, drag with one finger to reposition it
- Trolley smoothly follows your finger across detected surfaces
- Preserves rotation while moving
- Smooth animation (0.1s ease-out) for natural movement

**Implementation:**
- `DragGesture` with minimum distance of 10 points
- Real-time raycasting to find surface intersections
- Smooth transform interpolation

**Usage:**
```swift
// In ARTrolleyView
dragGesture: DragGesture(minimumDistance: 10)
    .onChanged { viewModel.handleDrag(to: $0.location) }
```

### 2. 🔄 Pinch to Rotate Trolley
**How it works:**
- Use two-finger pinch/rotate gesture to spin trolley around vertical axis
- Real-time rotation preview
- Haptic feedback on completion
- Rotation persists across movements

**Implementation:**
- `RotationGesture` for natural rotation feel
- Y-axis rotation (vertical axis)
- Base rotation tracking for cumulative rotations

**Usage:**
```swift
// In ARTrolleyView
rotationGesture: RotationGesture()
    .onChanged { viewModel.handleRotation(angle: $0) }
    .onEnded { viewModel.commitRotation(angle: $0) }
```

### 3. 👁️ Enhanced Trolley Visibility
**Improvements:**
- **Increased opacity**: 0.3 → 0.6 (100% increase)
- **Brighter colors**: 
  - Default: Cyan (60% opacity)
  - Manipulating: Yellow markers (90% opacity)
  - Ready: Green (60% opacity)
- **Larger markers**: 0.04m → 0.05m radius
- **Better contrast**: Yellow corner markers for high visibility

**Color States:**
| State | Frame Color | Marker Color | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Initial | Cyan (60%) | Yellow (90%) | High visibility for placement |
| Manipulating | Cyan (70%) | Yellow (90%) | Feedback during gesture |
| Ready | Green (60%) | Green (90%) | Confirmation cart is aligned |

### 4. 🌊 Enhanced Surface Detection
**Improvements:**
- **Increased plane opacity**: 0.25 → 0.5 (100% increase)
- **Subtle pulse animation**: Draws attention to detected surfaces
- **Better material**: Higher contrast cyan
- **Limited to 3 planes**: Prevents visual clutter

**Animation:**
- Gentle pulsing (scale 0.95 ↔ 1.0)
- 0.8 second duration with ease-in-out
- Helps identify where to place trolley

### 5. 📱 Gesture Instructions Overlay
**New UI element:**
- Appears when trolley is placed
- Shows available gestures:
  - 👆 "Drag to move"
  - 🔄 "Pinch to rotate"
- Positioned above capture button
- Uses `.ultraThinMaterial` for modern look

## Gesture System Architecture

### Gesture Hierarchy
```
SimultaneousGesture
├── DragGesture (move trolley)
└── SimultaneousGesture
    ├── RotationGesture (rotate trolley)
    └── TapGesture (initial placement)
```

### State Management
```
surfaceDetected → Tap to place
     ↓
cartPlaced → Can drag/rotate
     ↓
scanning → Continue drag/rotate
```

## Visual Feedback System

### Trolley Frame Colors
1. **Cyan**: Initial placement / manipulating
2. **Green**: Properly positioned and ready
3. **Brightness changes**: During active manipulation

### Corner Markers
- **Yellow**: Default / manipulating (high visibility)
- **Green**: Confirmed placement
- Always at 90% opacity for maximum visibility

### Detected Planes
- **Cyan overlay**: Shows detected horizontal surfaces
- **Pulsing animation**: Helps locate suitable placement areas
- **High contrast**: Easy to see in various lighting

## Performance Considerations

### Gesture Performance
- ✅ Simultaneous gestures don't conflict
- ✅ Minimum drag distance prevents accidental moves
- ✅ Smooth animations (0.1s) prevent jank
- ✅ Throttled updates maintain 60fps

### Visual Performance
- ✅ Limited to 3 plane visualizations
- ✅ Simple pulse animation (low CPU)
- ✅ No grid patterns (removed for performance)
- ✅ Efficient material updates

### Memory Impact
- **Gesture state**: Minimal (<1KB)
- **Visual updates**: No additional allocations
- **Animation**: Lightweight transform changes

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Initial Setup
```
Open Camera → AR Session Starts
       ↓
Move device around
       ↓
Surface detected (cyan plane appears with pulse)
       ↓
"Tap to place trolley" message
```

### 2. Placement
```
Tap on surface → Trolley appears (cyan + yellow markers)
       ↓
Gesture instructions appear
       ↓
State: "Trolley placed!"
```

### 3. Adjustment
```
Drag to reposition → Smooth movement across surface
OR
Pinch-rotate → Trolley spins around center
       ↓
Trolley color feedback (brightness changes)
       ↓
Release → Haptic feedback + position locked
```

### 4. Confirmation
```
Final position → Trolley turns green
       ↓
"Capture Photo" button ready
       ↓
Complete scan
```

## Accessibility

### Gesture Instructions
- Clear visual labels for each gesture
- SF Symbols for universal recognition
- High contrast backgrounds

### Visual Feedback
- Multiple color states for different conditions
- Haptic feedback confirms actions
- High opacity ensures visibility

### VoiceOver Support
- Gesture labels are accessible
- State changes announced
- Button labels provided

## Debugging

### Console Logs
- `✅ Placing guide trolley` - Trolley placed
- `🔄 Trolley rotated to: X radians` - Rotation completed
- `✅ Added plane visualization: ID - WxH` - Surface detected

### Visual Debugging
- Cyan overlay = Detected surface
- Yellow markers = Trolley can be manipulated
- Green = Trolley ready for capture

## Code Examples

### Handle Drag Gesture
```swift
func handleDrag(to location: CGPoint) {
    guard let arView = arView else { return }
    guard trolleyAnchor != nil else { return }
    
    let results = arView.raycast(
        from: location,
        allowing: .existingPlaneGeometry,
        alignment: .horizontal
    )
    
    guard let firstResult = results.first else { return }
    moveTrolleyCart(to: firstResult)
}
```

### Handle Rotation Gesture
```swift
func handleRotation(angle: Angle) {
    guard let trolleyAnchor = trolleyAnchor else { return }
    
    let rotationRadians = Float(angle.radians)
    let rotation = simd_quatf(
        angle: baseRotation + rotationRadians, 
        axis: SIMD3<Float>(0, 1, 0)
    )
    trolleyAnchor.orientation = rotation
    
    updateTrolleyVisibility(isManipulating: true)
}
```

### Update Visibility
```swift
static func updateGuideColor(
    entity: Entity, 
    isAligned: Bool, 
    brightness: CGFloat = 0.6
) {
    // Frame: Cyan → Green transition
    // Markers: Yellow → Green transition
    // Brightness: Adjustable 0.0-1.0
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Tap to place trolley on detected surface
- [ ] Drag trolley to new position (preserves rotation)
- [ ] Rotate trolley with pinch gesture
- [ ] Verify cyan overlay shows detected surfaces
- [ ] Check pulse animation on detected planes
- [ ] Confirm yellow markers visible in all lighting
- [ ] Test gesture instructions appear when placed
- [ ] Verify haptic feedback on rotation completion
- [ ] Check trolley turns green when ready
- [ ] Test all gestures work simultaneously

## Known Limitations

1. **Rotation**: Only Y-axis (vertical) rotation supported
2. **Movement**: Limited to detected horizontal surfaces
3. **Plane Limit**: Maximum 3 visualized planes
4. **Animation**: Simple pulse (no complex patterns)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Scale gesture to resize trolley
- [ ] Long-press to lock position
- [ ] Undo/redo for placement
- [ ] Snap to grid alignment
- [ ] Multi-trolley support
- [ ] Save favorite positions
