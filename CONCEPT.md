# Opsight - Airline Catering Vision System

## Hackathon Concept Document

### The Problem

**Gategroup's Challenge:**
- Airline catering operations waste significant resources due to cart loading errors
- Workers manually verify cart contents against manifests - time-consuming and error-prone
- Mistakes lead to:
  - Missing meals for passengers
  - Overstocking (wasted food)
  - Flight delays
  - Customer dissatisfaction
  - Environmental impact from food waste

**Current State:**
Workers check items manually with paper manifests or tablets, leading to human error, especially under time pressure.

---
